This project implements a compiler using the Python programming language. It takes a file written in the CutePy programming language (with the extension .cpy) as input and converts it into a format that is both understandable and executable by the computer (with the extension .asm).

CutePy is a small, educational programming language that resembles Python but is simpler in terms of supported structures and programming capabilities. Programs written in CutePy are designed to be runnable by a Python interpreter.
This project was developed as part of an educational assignment and completed over the course of an entire semester, with delivery divided into four phases:

Lexer and Parser
Intermediate Code Generator
Symbol Table
